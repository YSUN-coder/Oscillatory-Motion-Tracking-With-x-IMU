 Walking Pattern Comparision with Walking Sensor
=============================================
# Project Name: Walking Pattern Comparision
  This is to compute the sensor position according .h5 file
  This tool could remove noise signal in walking track sensor and then using accelerometer and gyroscope to compute x,y,z coordinate position
